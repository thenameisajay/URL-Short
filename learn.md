# URL Shortener Project

## Overview
URL Short is a straightforward project developed using the BERM (Bun-Express-React-MongoDB) stack. This web application serves the purpose of converting long URLs into shorter, more manageable links for users. The project's primary goal was to familiarize the developer with Bun, a recently released JavaScript runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner. Bun, created by Jarred Sumner, is designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js, offering a unique approach to JavaScript development. Unlike Node.js and Deno, which rely on the V8 JavaScript engine, Bun utilizes JavaScriptCore to simplify the development, testing, and bundling of JavaScript and TypeScript projects and make it a valuable tool for web developers.
